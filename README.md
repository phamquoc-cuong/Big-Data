# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. What is Big Data ?
- The term “big data” refers to data that is so large, fast or complex that it’s difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods
- Big data is defined data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the `3 Vs`.
  - **Volume**: Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, smart (IoT) devices, industrial equipment, videos, social media and more. In the past, storing it would have been a problem – but cheaper storage on platforms like data lakes and Hadoop have eased the burden.
  - **Velocity**: With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams in to businesses at an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart meters are driving the need to deal with these torrents of data in near-real time.
  - **Variety**: Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial transactions.
-  2 additional dimensions: `Value` (no use until that value is discovered) and `Veracity` (quality of data) 
  - **Veracity**: It refers to inconsistencies and uncertainty in data, that is data which is available can sometimes get messy and quality and accuracy are difficult to control.Big Data is also variable because of the multitude of data dimensions resulting from multiple disparate data types and sources.
  - **Value**: After having the 4 V’s into account there comes one more V which stands for Value!. The bulk of Data having no Value is of no good to the company, unless you turn it into something useful. Data in itself is of no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to extract Information. Hence, you can state that Value! is the most important V of all the 5V’s.
## 1.2. The history of big data
- Around 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through Facebook, YouTube, and other online services. 
- `Apache Hadoop` (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year
- The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, `Apache Spark` in 2014) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store.
- `Cloud computing` has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.
- [`Graph databases`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/big-data/what-is-graph-database/) are becoming increasingly important as well, with their ability to display massive amounts of data in a way that makes analytics fast and comprehensive.

## 1.3. How Big Data works
- There are 5 key steps to taking charge of this big “data fabric” that includes traditional, structured data along with unstructured and semistructured data
### 1.3.1. Set a big data strategy
- At a high level, a big data strategy is a plan designed to help you oversee and improve the way you acquire, store, manage, share and use data within and outside of your organization.
- A big data strategy sets the stage for business success amid an abundance of data. 
- When developing a strategy, it’s important to consider existing – and future – business and technology goals and initiatives. 
### 1.3.2. Know the sources of big data
- **Streaming data** comes from the Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices. You can analyze this big data as it arrives, deciding which data to keep or not keep, and which needs further analysis. 
- **Social media data** stems from interactions on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc. This includes vast amounts of big data in the form of images, videos, voice, text and sound – useful for marketing, sales and support functions. This data is often in `unstructured or semistructured` forms, so it poses a unique challenge for consumption and analysis. 
- **Publicly available data** comes from massive amounts of open data sources like the US government’s data.gov, the CIA World Factbook or the European Union Open Data Portal. 
- **Other big data** may come from data lakes, cloud data sources, suppliers and customers.
### 1.3.3. Access, manage and store big data
- Some data may be stored `on-premises` in a traditional `data warehouse` 
- There are also flexible, low-cost options for storing and handling big data via `cloud` solutions, `Data Lakes` and `Hadoop`.
### 1.3.4. Analyze big data
- `grid computing` or [`in-memory analytics`](https://www.sas.com/en_us/solutions/in-memory-analytics.html) used to analyse Big Data
- Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Put your data to work. (namely, `deep learning` to isolate hidden patterns and to find answers without over-fitting the data)
### 1.3.5. Make intelligent, data-driven decisions
- Data-driven organizations perform better, are operationally more predictable and are more profitable.
